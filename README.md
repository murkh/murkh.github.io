# ðŸ‘‹ About Me

Iâ€™m **Gaurav Panchal**, a passionate **Backend Developer** with over **3+ years of professional experience** in designing, building, and scaling backend systems.  
My career journey started with **Node.js**, and over time I transitioned to **Python**, where Iâ€™ve spent the last **2+ years** deeply involved in building production-grade systems.

I specialize in **FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB**, but my expertise extends beyond frameworks and databasesâ€”I care about **architecture, system design, and clean engineering practices**. My goal in every project is to ensure **scalability, maintainability, and reliability** while delivering business impact.
